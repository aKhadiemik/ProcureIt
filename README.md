- **User Interface and User Experience Design (Carlos Ageng`o):** Design user interfaces for simplicity and visual appeal.

## Technologies

### Backend

- Python (Django framework)
- MySQL database

### Frontend

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Other Technologies

- Git for version control
- GitHub for collaboration and repository management

## Alternative Technology Choices

1. **Backend:** Django instead of Flask. Django  chosen for its extensibility, aligning better with the project's specific requirements.

2. **Database:** Contemplated using PostgreSQL as an alternative to MySQL. MySQL was chosen for its widespread adoption, robust performance, and compatibility with Python libraries.

## Challenge

### Problem Statement

The ProcureIt application aims to simplify and streamline the procurement process for organizations, allowing for efficient management of purchase requests, approvals, and vendor interactions.

### What the Project Will Not Solve

ProcureIt will not handle financial transactions or payment processing. It will focus solely on procurement management.

## Target Users

The application will cater to procurement teams within organizations of various sizes, helping them manage purchase requests, track approvals, and communicate with vendors effectively.

## Locale Dependency

ProcureIt is designed to be locale-independent, ensuring usability across different regions and languages.

## Risks

### Technical Risks

- **Database Scalability:** Implementing database optimization techniques and considering sharding if necessary to address scalability issues with the MySQL database.

- **Integration Complexity:** Thorough API compatibility tests and backup plans in case of any integration issues with third-party APIs.

### Non-Technical Risks

- **User Adoption:** Providing comprehensive training and support to ensure a smooth transition from existing procurement processes.

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Conducting regular compliance audits and staying up-to-date with relevant procurement regulations and data protection laws.

## Infrastructure

### Version Control

Github flow branching model employed for this repository, maintaining separate branches for features, releases, and hotfixes. Pull requests used for code review.

### Deployment

The application built to be deployed either on-premise or over PaaS's platforms like AWS or Heroku. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines set up for automated deployment.

### Data Population

Sample data used for testing purposes. For production, users will input their own procurement data through the application.

### Testing

Automated testing frameworks like PyTest uused for backend testing and Jest for frontend testing. Continuous integration to ensure that tests are run with every code push.
